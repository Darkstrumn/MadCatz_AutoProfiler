Cyborg Auto-Profiler Source
by Danny Hasley


Due to request from my users to release the source code, along with the fact I do not have any Cyborg devices anymore. I have decided to release the source to the public in hopes that you the users can continue my work.
I've never released any of my source codes before, so I must warn you, it doesn't have as many comments as it should, but there is some. I'm an amateur programmer so don't be surprised by sloppy coding.

Not sure what else to say.. 


Thanks to all my users for the support, and complements throughout the development of the software. 
To the many users to suggested many of the great features the software has. You guys had the true vision for the software, I just built it.

and very special thanks to Michael Colesky for MMO7 LED Color assistance, and introducing me to the Saitek.Devices.Dll. He truly helped shape the path the software took.

Well, I'll leave it in everyone's hands now. Feel free to ask me any questions about the code.

Thanks,

Danny Hasley
